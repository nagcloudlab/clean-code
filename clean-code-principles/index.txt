1. Eliminate if/else branching; early termination
2. Ambiguous definitions: ‘is’ function prefix to denote boolean return
3. Self documenting code: avoid belaboured comments
4. Consistent formatting. Use Eslint + Prettier to automate code style
5. DRY business logic. Look for opportunities to refactor. Make sure to test!
6. Fail or exit functions fast. Related to 1.
7. Avoid magic values - declare and use CONSTANTS instead.
8. Avoid violating single responsibility. Prefer to use pure functions (no side effects)
9. Overly clever code (code golf). Leads to impenetrable single liners (have to rewrite in order to debug)
10. Premature optimisations.
